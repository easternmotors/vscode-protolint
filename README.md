# vscode-protolint

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/plexsystems/vscode-protolint.

Notable changes:

- `protolint.path` now works properly to point to a local executable file instead of having protolint added to your PATH
- `protolint.configPath` is added to point to a local configuration file instead of needing it available at the root of your project
- Code is simplified to feel more approachable to developers (hopefully)
- Packaged extension is now 7.32KB
